📝 10 Practice Questions Based on Sentinel Logic
🟢 Easy (1–3)
1. Find the index of a key using sentinel search

Given an array of numbers and a key, return its index using sentinel linear search.

2. Check if an element exists

Return true or false using sentinel search.

3. Count how many times a key appears

Modify sentinel search to count occurrences.

🟡 Medium (4–7)
4. Search in an array of strings

Use sentinel linear search to find a string in an array of strings.

5. Return all indexes where key occurs

Implement sentinel search and return all positions of the key.

6. Search in a partially sorted array

If first half sorted, second half random:
Use sentinel search to find an element.

7. Find element but keep array unchanged

Demonstrate why restoring last element is important.
Write code that prints array BEFORE and AFTER.

🔴 Advanced (8–10)
8. Implement sentinel search on a linked list

(Manually create a sentinel node at end, then restore)

9. Compare normal vs sentinel search

Measure total comparisons for:

linear search

sentinel search

For multiple inputs.

10. Self-adjusting sentinel linear search

When an element is found, move it to front (like move-to-front heuristic).

This boosts future lookups.
Combine sentinel search + optimization.
